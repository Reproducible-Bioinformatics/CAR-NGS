# CARN Project Overview

## Abstract:
The Comprehensive Analysis and Research Network (CARN) project is a groundbreaking initiative in genomics and bioinformatics. It aims to simplify Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis and ensure 100% reproducibility. By integrating various NGS pipelines into a user-friendly interface within the Galaxy platform, CARN democratizes genomic analysis, making it accessible to researchers of all backgrounds. Leveraging Docker containers, the project guarantees reproducibility across different computing environments. Furthermore, CARN is committed to open source principles, fostering collaboration and innovation within the genomics community.

## Objective:
The primary objective of the CARN project is to democratize genomics by simplifying NGS data analysis and ensuring reproducibility. It aims to empower researchers, including biologists, biotechnologists, and computational scientists, to perform advanced genomic analyses independently.

## Innovation:
CARN introduces several innovative features:
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A user-friendly interface within the Galaxy platform simplifies complex genomic analyses, making them accessible to researchers with varying levels of computational expertise.
- **Comprehensive NGS Pipelines:** CARN integrates a wide range of NGS pipelines, covering techniques such as single-cell RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, whole genome sequencing, ATAC-seq, and TCR repertoire analysis.
- **Reproducibility Through Docker:** Leveraging Docker containers ensures 100% reproducibility in NGS data analysis across different computing environments.
- **Open Source Collaboration:** All developed codes and packages are open source, fostering collaboration, transparency, and innovation within the genomics community.

## Expected Impact:
The CARN project aims to accelerate scientific discovery by making NGS data analysis more accessible and reproducible. By empowering researchers with easy-to-use tools, it addresses the bioinformatics bottleneck and fosters collaboration within the genomics community.

## Main Activities:
1. **Tool Backend Development:** Rewrite R functions and merge Docker4seq with RCASC, incorporating new NGS functionalities.
2. **Tool Front End Implementation:** Develop a user-friendly front end with cross-platform compatibility.
3. **User and Network Management:** Establish user account management, data storage integration using Scalaway S3, and compute resource management with SLURM.
4. **Dataset Testing:** Select gold-standard datasets for each NGS category and perform subset datasets for testing.
5. **Promoting:** Engage in community outreach, education, and training through platforms like Elixir and RNA-seq courses.

## Conclusion:
The CARN project aims to launch a fully operational NGS analysis tool accessible through the University of Turin's high-performance computing infrastructure. The open-source nature of the project encourages community engagement and continuous improvement, setting a precedent for collaborative development and innovation in bioinformatics.
